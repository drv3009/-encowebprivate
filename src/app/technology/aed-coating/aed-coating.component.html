  <h2 class="fnt-raleway"><strong>Powder Coating</strong></h2>
  <p class="fnt-lato">
    Powder coating is an older technology and used only in lower salt spray
    conditions. As of now we recommend customers to go for ED coating for most
    products â€“ however if you have a specific application that requires powder
    coating technology we would be happy to provide the service.
